# My_Snapchat

Group project (2 teammates) | 1 weeks | React Native, Expo
                                                                           
My teammates and I have created a Snapchat like mobile app.                                           
We had to build the client side only and use the routes of a given API.                                         
My main tasks were to create the functionalities to take a photo with the camera or from the gallery, draw on the image and send the snapshots (Post.js file).
