# My_Snapchat

Group project (2 teammates) | 1 weeks | React Native Expo
                                                                           
My teammates and I created a Snapchat-like mobile app.                                           
We had to build the client side only and use the routes of a given API.                                         
My main tasks were to take a picture with the camera or from the gallery, draw on the image and send the snaps (Post.js).
